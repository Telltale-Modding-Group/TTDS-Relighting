TLSE | Telltale Lua Script Extensions

- (.lua) a pre-compiled script that is used by the game to run gameplay logic.

This specific archive stores many Lua scripts that are here to help extend the existing Telltale Lua API of a project.

They enhance existing Telltale Lua API functions, but also implement many new ones as well to make scripting a lot easier and certain tasks more achievable. It's worth noting that not every script in this archive may be used, so treat this archive almost like a toolbox. 

Almost every function in the library also is prefixed with "TLSE_" as Lua does not really support namespaces. NOTE: This could have been circumvented by using a package like system as explained here - https://www.lua.org/pil/15.1.html - however this introduces a bit of scripting complexity so it's simpler to just include the script when you need it, and call the uniquely named function globally.
